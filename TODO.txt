FIXME:
  - what happens if a message is over 255?
  - what if the file is manually edited?
  - do we let users cleanup the file?
  - are notifications cleaned up from memory?
  - if we have 10 messages all set to trigger at the same time it will take 10seconds to run through them
      move notify / tree traversal into a method to recurse?
