FIXME:
  - what happens if a message is over 255?
  - what if the file is manually edited?
  - do we let users cleanup the file?
  - are notifications cleaned up from memory?
  - code organization? what should go in the lib?
  - providing an API?
  - properly daemonize the daemon?
  - make notify an API call rather than in the daemon for linking different notification interfaces?
  - install scripts / configure calls?
