FIXME:

  - setup post initial scan to filetail or setup some type of internal queue/ds for handling notifications. 
    current impl opens a file and iterates nonstop over the entire thing. Super inefficent.
    tailing the file for changes would/should help with the processing time
    need to account for non marked done times in the file and a way to mark them as done. 
    
      struct remnode { 
          long fileptr;
          reminder* reminder;
          remnode* prev;
          remnode* next;
      }
    
     this in theory should work. 
     == THIS IS WIP I've started this but its not fully implemented
